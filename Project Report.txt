Description

Approach

	Queue and MyQueue: I wanted to make my queues as simple as possible to implement so I 
	could get started on the bigger project so I implemented it as a bounded circular array.
	I know that it will never have to hold more than a certain number of movies of which it 
	will know how many before hand so I figured no harm in making it bounded. Even when the 
	user can add movies to the list, the file will keep track of the # of movies. I can always
	make it unbounded later too.
	
	PriorityQueue: I implemented this as simply as I could as well. It's just an array of queues. 
	I did have some problems with generic type casting but I suppressed the warnings. The queue is 
	built so that it's size is actually the size the user gives it multiplied by the number of priorities
	that the user wants. That way the user can add all the elements to the queue even if they all have the 
	same priority. 
	
	

Test Cases
Key: Working As Expected = WAE
	 Unknown Bug = UB
	 Known Bug = KB

	Individual Class Tests (Modular Testing):
	
		MyQueue: Completely functional. 10/06/2011. WAE
		
			Case 1: tested enqueue operation, 
					filled up queue until it was full and then tried to add another element,
					element was not added, false was returned. 10/06/2011. WAE.
			
			Case 2: tested dequeue operation,
					dequeued a full queue until it was empty and then tried to dequeue again
					null was returned and no element was removed. 10/06.2011 WAE.
					
			Case 3: tested circular array functionality
					enqueued several elements, dequeued several elements, enqueued several more
					to ensure wrap around. No problems occurred, all elements accounted for. 10/06/2011 WAE.
		
		PriorityQueue:
			
			Case 1: tested enqueue operation,
				    enqueued elements until full with various priorities then enqueued one more
				    new element was not added false was returned. enqueued elements with all the 
				    same priorities until full and tried to add one more, element was not added
				    false was returned. 10/06/2010. WAE.
				    
			Case 2: tested dequeue operation,
					tried to dequeue an empty queue, null was returned. filled up a queue and removed
					all elements, then tried to remove one more, null was returned. Added elements of 
					different priorities in different orders, when dequeued all elements came out in 
					order of priority and then by FIFO style. 10/06/2011 WAE.
