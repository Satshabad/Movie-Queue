 * This assignment is to create a netflix like movie
 * 
 * queue by which the user can sort search a
 * library of movies as well as add movies to
 * their queue by priority rather than just
 * FIFO order. They may freely switch
 * between FIFO and priority order. The
 * Queues are persistent and the library is extensible.
